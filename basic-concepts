Fundamental Concepts:
  
 0. Command Line switches or options
 1. Compilation,
 2. Link,
 
 3. Preprocessing,
 4. Translation Unit,
 
 5. Two different ways
  to define preprocessing macros
  
  
A. cl hello.cpp
 
 (1) Compiles and generates hello.obj --- object file 
 and 
 (2) links hello.exe --- executable file
 

 Command line switch
 
 /c - compiles only ... do not generate exe file
   
 Compilation means the process that generates obj file 
 .obj files are called object files.
 
 cl hello.obj 
  links hello.obj and generates exe or executable file
  
 Link means generate executable files.
 
cl hello.cpp --- means compile and link and generate executables.

cl /c hello.cpp ---- compile only and generate obj file
cl hello.obj ---- link to generate exe file

The primary reason to separately compile and link 
is for the efficiency of the build process

"Build" means "compile" and "link" and "generate" executables
"Compile" means to generate object file (or .obj)
"Link" means generate executable or exe or dll files.

"Preprocessing" means replace #include directive's header contents
 in the .cpp file.
 
 
"Compilation" is two-step processes

 1. "Preprocess" include files
 2. "Generate" object files
 
During "Preprocessing" stage,
 the compiler substitutes preprocessor macros
 
"Translation Unit" means .cpp files that is preprocessed.
